# NPSPImport-Excel-Formatter
This Community Sprint project is to market, distribute and improve an Excel tool that helps group contacts into households in a format ready for NPSP Data Import.

# Project Overview
When itâ€™s time to migrate data from a legacy system, how do we get Contacts into the same Household together? In order to use NPSP's Data Import records to group contacts into households, the input file must be in a format with two contacts in the same row, while source datasets typically come with one contact per row. We have developed an Excel spreadsheet with an embedded VisualBasic program that makes it easier to get contact data into import-ready format. Help spread the word about this tool, support and standardize its distribution and improve its functionality. Here is a demo of the tool: https://youtu.be/NGU43QEsObE
